| | Business UpdateAs a result of significant growth, our infrastructure â€” namely the dynamic routing of traffic to accommodate high volume customers â€” has recently required updates. Reworking architecture patterns and proxy configurations has taken us a fair amount of time, which in turn has led to some slower customer issue resolution.We'd like to assure you that weâ€™ve identified and corrected the infrastructural shortcomings, and the outcome is a 50% increase in infrastructure and proxy capacity. We apologize for the potential business interruptions you may have experienced over the last couple months. Our aim is to earn your trust back and continue to support the realization of your business goals. Please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch if you require further information. |
