Category Results
----------------

When making a request with the `type` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/category) set to `type=category` Rainforest API will return category listing results from the URL specified in the `url` parameter or the Category ID specified in the `category_id` parameter (where the `category_id` is returned from the [Categories API](/docs/categories-api/overview)) and the Amazon domain in `amazon_domain` parameter.

Category results are retrieved from the [category listing pages](https://www.amazon.com/s?bbn=16225009011&rh=n%3A%2116225009011%2Cn%3A502394%2Cn%3A281052) on Amazon.

{"request\_info":{...}"request\_metadata":{...}"request\_parameters":{...}"category\_results":[...]"category\_list":[...]"pagination":{...}"refinements":{...}}CopyRainforest API returns the following properties for Category requests:

PropertyTypeDescriptioncategory\_resultsarrayAn array of Category Result objects, containing each of the product results shown on the category listing page. The Category Result object has the following properties:  
positionnumberThe position of the result on the category listing page.titlestringThe product name.asinstringThe Amazon product ID (ASIN) for the product.linkstringThe product page link.is\_primebooleanDetermines whether the product is Prime-eligible or not.imagestringA link to the image of the product.sponsoredbooleanSet to `true` or `false` depending on whether the category result is a sponsored listing, or not.add\_on\_itemobject**Add-On Item Object**The add-on item object is present when the item is part of the Amazon 'add-on item' program. The property will be omitted if the product is not an add-on item.is\_add\_on\_itembooleanTrue/false indicating whether the product is an add-on item.categoriesarray**Categories Array**An array containing details of the categories shown with this product as displayed next to the search bar at the top of the page.  
  
Each object in the array contains the following properties:namestringThe name of the category (i.e. "Toys & Games").bestsellerobject**Bestseller Object**An object containing details of whether the product is a bestseller and if so, in which category. The `bestseller` object has the following properties:categorystringThe name of the category (i.e. "Toys & Games") in which this product is a bestseller.ratingnumberThe overall rating of the product, out of 5.ratings\_totalnumberThe total number of customer ratings the product has received.pricesarray**Prices Array**The prices array contains details about the products pricing, as shown underneath the product title. It is an array of `price` objects, the properties of which are described below:symbolstringThe currency symbol, i.e. `$` for USD.valuenumberThe price of the Offer.currencystringThe currency of the Offer as a [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code.rawstringThe raw price as displayed on the Offer listing.namestringThe name of the price if applicable, for example "Kindle", "Hardcover".priceobjectA price object representing the first item in the `prices` array. This is normally the "main" price for the product and is included as a convienience to make extracting the main price easier.category\_listarrayAn array of Category List objects. This property is populated when an "intermediate" category URL is specified in the requests' `url` parameter (see [example](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=284507)). "Intermediate" category URLs are category landing pages that typically show a branded list of sub-categories.  
  
**Note** that the categories returned in `category_list` are retrieved from the category listing page itself, rather than via the [Categories API](/docs/categories-api/overview).  
  
The Category List object has the following properties:  
titlestringThe title of the sub-category linked-to from the intermediate category page.linkstringA link to the sub-category from the intermediate category page. Could we passed to a subsequent `type=category` request via the `url` request parameter to retrieve category listings from that page.imagestringThe image of the sub-category from the intermediate category page, if shown.refinementsobjectAn object containing details of the available refinements for the given category results. These allow you to refine your category by values such as "Reviews rating 4 and over", "price range" and "brand". To refine your category results by a given refinement value you should specify refinement values, comma seperated, in your request's `refinements` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/category).  
  
Refinement values are dynamic and change by category area used. If you wish to use refinements you should first issue a `type=category` request without specifying any `refinements` to retrieve a master list of the avaialble refinements for the given category area/category term. You can then cache these refinement values for use on subsequent requests.  
  
The `refinements` object has a property name for each refinement that is available. This property contains an array showing the full-text refinement name and an value. It is this value that you should specify, comma seperated, in your request's `refinements` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/category).  
  
**Note** that sometimes Amazon do not present a explicit refinement value and instead a `link` is returned. In this instance you should pass the `link` into the `url` request parameter of a subsequent `type=category` request to retrieve data from that refinement-filtered page.  
namestringThe full-text name of the refinement, for example "Brand".valuestringThe value of the refinement, you should specify the refinement value(s), comma seperated, in your request's `refinements` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/category).linkstringThe link shown for the refinement, you can use the link in a new `type=category` request's `url` parameter to navigate to the category results filtered by this refinement.category\_informationobjectAn object containing details of the current page of category results.  
is\_landing\_pagebooleanSet to `true` when the current page is a category landing page (see [example](https://www.amazon.de/s?node=78689031)). A category landing page is a higher level summary page. If you encounter one you should iterate to a lower level category, or use the `refinements` request parameter, to traverse down to a category listing page.paginationobjectAn object containing details of the current category listing page and the total number of pages that are available.  
current\_pagenumberThe current page number.total\_pagesnumberThe total number of pages available.Next Steps
