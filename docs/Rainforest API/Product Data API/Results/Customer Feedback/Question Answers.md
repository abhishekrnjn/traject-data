Question Answers Results
------------------------

The Question Answers Parameters are applicable when making a request with `type=question_answers` to retrieve all answers for a single question on Amazon - the question is specified using either the `question_id` and `amazon_domain` parameters or the `url` parameter (where the `url` parameter contains a link to a question answers page). The parameters should be appended as querystring parameters to the Product Data API`GET`HTTP request.

Question Answers are retrieved from the [customer question answers page](https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx2YPKCGKAORFA4/1) for a single question on Amazon.
