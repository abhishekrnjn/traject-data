Review Comments Results
-----------------------

When making a request with the `type` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/review-comments) set to `type=review_comments` Rainforest API will return all Customer Review Comments for the Review ID specified using the `review_id`, `asin` and `amazon_domain` parameters.

Review comments are retrieved from the [customer reviews page](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B073JYC4XM) for a single customer review for a single product on Amazon.
