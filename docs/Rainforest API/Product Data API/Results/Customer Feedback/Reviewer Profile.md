Reviewer Profile Results
------------------------

When making a request with the `type` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/reviewer-profile) set to `type=reviewer_profile` Rainforest API will return details of reviewer specified in either the `reviewer_id` and `amazon_domain` parameters or the `url` parameter.

Reviewer profile details are retrieved from the [reviewer profile page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHBEI6Q4F4WHRIFK5CWQMRVPOQMA). You can retrieve the `reviewer_id` value for a given reviewer from other Rainforest requests, such as `type=reviews` requests.
