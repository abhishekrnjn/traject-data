Bestsellers Results
-------------------

When making a request with the `type` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/bestsellers) set to `type=bestsellers` Rainforest API will return Bestseller results from an Amazon bestsellers page - the bestsellers page is specified either using the `category_id` and `amazon_domain` parameters (where `category_id` is a Category ID returned from the [Categories API](/docs/categories-api/overview), or by using the `url` parameter.

Rainforest supports all types of Amazon Bestseller pages, [bestsellers](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Appliances/zgbs/appliances/ref=zg_bs_nav_0), [new releases](https://www.amazon.com/gp/new-releases/appliances/ref=zg_bsnr_nav_0), [movers & shakers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers/appliances/ref=zg_bsms_nav_0), [most wished for](https://www.amazon.com/gp/most-wished-for/appliances/ref=zg_mw_nav_0) and [gift ideas](https://www.amazon.com/gp/most-gifted/appliances/ref=zg_mg_nav_0).
