Seller Products Results
-----------------------

The Seller Products Parameters are applicable when making a request with `type=seller_products` to retrieve seller product listing results for a single seller on Amazon - the seller is specified using either the `seller_id` and `amazon_domain` parameters or the `url` parameter (where the `url` parameter contains a link to an Amazon seller product listing page). The parameters should be appended as querystring parameters to the Product Data API`GET`HTTP request.

Seller product listing results are retrieved from the [seller product listings page](https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A02211013Q5HP3OMSZC7W&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER) for a single seller on Amazon. You can retrieve the `seller_id` value for a given seller from other Rainforest requests, such as `type=offers` requests.

You can then cache these refinement values for use on subsequent requests.  
  
The `refinements` object has a property name for each refinement that is available. This property contains an array showing the full-text refinement name and an value. It is this value that you should specify, comma seperated, in your request's `refinements` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/seller-products).
