Seller Profile Results
----------------------

When making a request with the `type` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/seller-profile) set to `type=seller_profile` Rainforest API will return details of seller specified in either the `seller_id` and `amazon_domain` parameters or the `url` parameter.

Seller profile details are retrieved from the [seller profile page](https://www.amazon.com/sp?seller=A02211013Q5HP3OMSZC7W) for a single seller on Amazon. You can retrieve the `seller_id` value for a given seller from other Rainforest requests, such as `type=offers` requests.

You can use subsequent [seller products](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/seller-products) and [seller feedback](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/seller-feedback) requests to retrieve iterate all of the products and customer feedback from a given seller.
