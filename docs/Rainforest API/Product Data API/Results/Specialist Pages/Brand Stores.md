Store Results
-------------

When making a request with the `type` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/store) set to `type=store` Rainforest API will return Brand Store results for a Brand Store. The Brand Store can be specified either by the `url` parameter, or by a combination of the `store_id` and `amazon_domain` parameters. The parameters should be appended as querystring parameters to the Product Data API`GET`HTTP request.

Brand Store results are retrieved from the [brand store page](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/70F3122D-4966-4242-A8A6-871C8D7E6F8B) on Amazon.

**Editorial Results**  
Store result pages can have different layouts and are not always a standard list of ASIN results. If a `store_result` has the `type=editorial` then the ASIN is being displayed as a graphic/creative, instead of a regular ASIN product listing. In this instance the `title` field is not available (as the text of the product title is shown in the creative image instead) and a `editorial_image` field containing the creative image is returned.Rainforest API returns the following properties for Brand Store requests:
