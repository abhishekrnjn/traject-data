DESKTOPTABLETMOBILEScale SERP parses regular Google web search results when the `search_type` parameter is omitted.

![](https://apiimages.imgix.net/scaleserp/images/png/docs/google_search.png?auto=format&ixlib=react-9.5.1-beta.1&w=600)Google Search ResultsBelow is an example of how the Google Search results are represented in the Scale SERP result JSON. Note that the example below is fictitious as there are too many different sections to the Google Search result to be included in one response:
